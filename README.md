## Hi, I'm Asmahan Mohamed 👋🏾


### A bit about me:
💻 I'm currently learning web development with [Founders & Coders] (https://github.com/foundersandcoders) as part of their 2022 Skills Bootcamp. Like many, I discovered coding during the pandemic, and I thoroughly enjoy how technical and creative it is!

### My background: 
✨ I'm a law graduate with experience in commercial, intellectual property, and contract law. I interned at Nissan for a year before graduating and working in immigration law- I currently run my own business where I design and sell my line of hijabs and accessories.

### What I'm focusing on:
🎯 My current goal is: to continue improving my programming skills through working on projects. I also hope to collaborate more with others and eventually earn the title of Software Developer!
